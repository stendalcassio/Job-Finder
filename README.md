# Job-Finder


In this project I used the technologies: html, css, bootstrap, javascript, node in the backend and also the sqlite database. 
I learned several new concepts such as using handlebars, 
also using postman to test the api and integration with the frontend.

*the whole project is responsive for different screen types*
