# Job-Finder


In this project I used the technologies: html, css, bootstrap, javascript, node in the backend with express and also the sqlite database. 
I learned several new concepts such as using handlebars, 
also using postman to test the api and integration with the frontend.

In this project, participating in job searches based on the name of the vacancy, we were also able to create a new job opportunity that is automatically rendered on the home page and listed one by one in descending order of creation.

*the whole project is responsive for different screen types*
